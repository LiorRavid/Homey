Apartment is super light and bright, and literally footsteps from the sand. kitchen is super functional and well equipped with everything you need. Location is excellent - literally footsteps from the beach, and 500mtrs to the north or south for a great selection of cafes and restaurants. Communication with Laura was fast.

Every positive review is absolutely accurate, he really is fantastic. The neighborhood is centrally located and a short walk from major metro stops and a 10 minute walk to most major tourist destinations. Close enough for convenience and far enough to have a quiet place to stay that was a great representation of the diversity of Madrid. The apartment is fantastic and JosÃ© is happy to give you recommendations, binge watch Game of Thrones with you or give you privacy when you need it. At one point I got very sick and he even went to the pharmacy for me. If you're a solo female traveler, this neighborhood like most of Madrid, is VERY safe! I took many late night walks alone. The apartment is on the top floor with no elevator so if you have mobility issues, you should consider that. Otherwise, stay here! Thank you so much, JosÃ©!",
