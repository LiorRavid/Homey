Close enough for convenience and far enough to have a quiet place to stay that was a great representation of the diversity of Madrid. The apartment is fantastic and José is happy to give you recommendations, binge watch Game of Thrones with you or give you privacy when you need it. At one point I got very sick and he even went to the pharmacy for me. If you're a solo female traveler, this neighborhood like most of Madrid, is VERY safe! I took many late night walks alone. The apartment is on the top floor with no elevator so if you have mobility issues, you should consider that. Otherwise, stay here! Thank you so much, José!",
